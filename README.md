AirBnB project is a demo project that involves cloning the AirBnB App. Each task is put in place a parent class called BaseModel to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances. create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file. Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel. Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage. Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
